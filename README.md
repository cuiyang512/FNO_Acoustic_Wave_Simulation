# FNO_Acoustic_Wave_Simulation
We used the Fourier Neural Operator to Simulate the Acoustic Wave in Time Domain

# Reference
We utilized the FNO-torch 1.6.0 in this package:  https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator/tree/master/FNO-torch.1.6
We also made some modifications using this package: https://github.com/yanyangg/AcousticNeuralOperator
